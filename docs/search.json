    "text": "Answer the questions in a Quarto document that compiles to PDF. Make sure that all your code is neat and readable, equations are typeset nicely with LaTeX, and figures render nicely. The Quarto documentation is excellent.\n\nFor mathematical problems, work out the answers with paper-and-pencil first, then move the answers to a Quarto document (while simultaneously reviewing and polishing).\nFor coding problems, write and debug the code in a standalone .R script first, then move the code to a Quarto code chunk.\n\nAt the beginning of the semester, start a new R project called exr/. Each week, create a new .qmd document named 01-exr.qmd, 02-exr.qmd, …, to exr/. (You can adjust these names if you like.) Throughout the semester you’ll have several PDFs that you can revise and review as you prepare for the exams.\nMake sure to render often as you work in a .qmd file (e.g., every time you add a new part).\nUse the tinytable to automate table creation.\nThe default output of tt(), modelsummary(), ggplot(), etc. is almost always “good enough” for our purposes. Don’t spend lots of time polishing your tables, plots, and output. Use that time and energy to focus on understanding the ideas, math, and code.\nAn exception to the rule above is carefully controlling the output of code chunks. In most cases, you want messages: false and warnings: false. You don’t want a lot of junk in your rendered documents, but it’s fine if your column and axis labels have the raw variable names."

It forces you to develop a thorough understanding of an idea and constantly re-engage with your understanding.\nThe workshop also mirrors important professional activities: conference presentations and job talks, teaching, collaboration, and reproducible research."

It is lightweight document that reduces friction and builds interest.\n\n\nSlides\nA set of slides to show during the presentation.\nThe slides should support a roughly 15-minute conceptual lecture portion of the workshop.\nThe slides do not need to be comprehensive.2 Perhaps 6-8 slides are enough. Use slides to emphasize the big ideas concepts or show visuals.3 (It’s fine to use an analog or digital chalkboard for portions of the lecture!)\n2 The take-home notes can include the supporting details.3 Again, reserve complicated equations for handouts.\n\nTwo Examples\nTwo diverse examples from political science.\n\nUse the first example as a live-coding example for your workshop.\nUse the second example as a hands-on exercise for your participants.\n\n\n\nA Take-Home Handout\nTake-home handout that summarizes all the content from the workshop. This document is a substitute for the workshop. You can easily write a reproducible document in Quarto.\n\nIt should cover the conceptual and mathematical ideas from the lecture, but in somewhat greater detail. Something like two pages of text seems about right, excluding large equations, figures, and tables.\nIt should include the two examples worked out in detail. In Quarto, it’s easy to mix the prose, code, equations, and figures, so use those features to clearly explain the concepts and software. Make sure to focus on the important points—it’s easy to make pages and pages of relatively unimportant code and output. The length of this section will depend heavily on the nature of the examples, but each example should load and inspect data, fit models, compute quantities of interest, and plot the quantities of interest.\nIt should include a few references in case participants want to learn more. For each references, write a few words about why participants might use that resource."

Audience unclear on what the model is or when to use it.\n\n\nExamples (Live Coding & Hands-On)\nTwo well-chosen, diverse political science examples. Live coding is clear and reproducible and links model, code, and conclusions. Hands-on exercise is achievable in ~15–20 minutes with starter code/data.\nRelevant but uneven examples (one strong, one weak; too complex; or loosely tied to political science). Coding works but may be hard to follow. Hands-on exercise somewhat too hard or easy.\nPoorly chosen, irrelevant, or not reproducible. Coding fails or confuses. Hands-on exercise missing or unusable.\n\n\nMaterials (Read-Ahead, Slides, Handout)\nRead-ahead is short, engaging, and practical. Slides emphasize big ideas and visuals. Handout is reproducible, integrates text/code/figures/references, and works as a standalone resource.\nMaterials are present but uneven (too long read-ahead, overly dense slides, incomplete or cluttered handout). Some reproducibility issues.\nMaterials missing, incoherent, or cannot be followed independently.\n\n\nDelivery\nWorkshop stays on time and follows structure. Delivery is confident, clear, and interactive. Live coding is smooth with backup plan. Audience is engaged and participates.\nDelivery understandable but uneven (rushed, monotone, or overly technical). Some interaction but limited engagement. Minor coding/timing issues.\nWorkshop disorganized, unclear, or off schedule. Little to no interaction. Technical failures derail session.\n\n\nProfessionalism\nTeamwork is balanced. Materials are polished and proofed. Overall presentation mirrors professional standards (conference/job talk quality).\nTeamwork uneven or materials lack polish (typos, sloppy figures, unclear code). Still functional overall.\nOne person carries the work or team uncoordinated. Materials unprofessional, incomplete, or sloppy."

    "section": "Overview",
    "text": "Overview\nWe’ll borrow Gerring’s (2012, 722) definition of a descriptive argument:\n\nA descriptive argument describes some aspect of the world. In doing so, it aims to answer what questions (e.g., when, whom, out of what, in what manner) about a phenomenon or a set of phenomena. Descriptive arguments are about what is/was. For example: ‘Over the course of the past two centuries there have been three major waves of democratization.’\n\nYou might feel confused. After all, Gerring writes that description “has come to be employed as a euphemism for a failed, or not yet proven, causal inference.” At best, we might think that description only serves to support the primary task of causal inference. Indeed, King, Keohane, and Verba (1994, 34) write that “description, in turn, loses most of its interest unless linked to some causal relationships.”\nHowever, description is an essential component of social science. de Kadt and Grzymala-Busse (2025) argue that description is “a fundamental component of the social scientific enterprise” (2) that “engages theory by invoking existing theories, motivating new theoretical models and their refinement, and in some cases even evaluating theory” (24). Gerring writes that “description can be written out of the discipline only at great cost to our understandings of the world” (744). And Holmes et al. (2024) write that “answering questions of ‘who,’ ‘what,’ ‘when,’ ‘where,’ and ‘how’—in concert with but also independent from causal inquiry—is vital to the continued relevance and coherence of our discipline in both scholarly and public-facing work” (54).\nAs a whole, I suggest that social science asks: how can we intervene to make the world a better place? This implies three parts.\n\nFirst, what does the world look like now?\nSecond, what worlds would be better?\nAnd third, what are the effects of potential interventions?\n\nI view answers the the first question—a description of the world as it exists—as a difficult and worthwhile challenge. It seems difficult to even entertain the second and third questions without a thorough understanding of the world as it exists.\nAnd you may think that description is easy, and establishing causality is hard. I think you’ll find that description is easier statistically, but a more difficult struggle overall.1\n1 My thinking is something like this. When you randomly assign \\(T\\) and you measure \\(Y\\) afterward, you’ve established that \\(T\\) causes \\(X\\). But suppose that you just measure \\(Y\\). It isn’t clear what you’ve just measured or whether it’s meaningful. Of course, these same questions lay hiding in the shadows in the randomized experiment. But the randomization guarantees a “causal inference” that is sufficient to strike our fancy. The descriptive argument brings the subtler questions of measures and their meanings into the broad daylight. Fuzzy concepts and measurements can’t hide behind a “compelling identification strategy” when you are making a descriptive argument.Examples of the struggle to describe are easy to find. Consider two ideas that are central to political science: “democracy” or “political ideology.” If a reporter from the New York Times asked whether democracy was in decline around the world, the answer isn’t easy or obvious. Political scientists are not in agreement. If that reporter asked you whether there are many or few moderate voters in the US, the answer isn’t obvious or easy. Again, political scientists are not in agreement."

    "text": "A Recent Debate About Moderates\nA recent exchange in the American Political Science Review centers on how best to characterize ideological moderation in the American public. In the original article, Fowler et al. (2023) develop a statistical model to distinguish among types of moderates, finding that while a single ideological dimension captures most Americans’ policy views, moderates—especially those not neatly aligned—remain central to electoral accountability. In response, Broockman and Lauderdale (2025) critique this approach, arguing that it overestimates the number of genuinely one-dimensional voters and fails to account for individuals with cross-pressured or multidimensional views. Finally, Fowler et al. (2024) reply by showing that Broockman and Lauderdale’s visual and simulation-based critiques do not invalidate their main conclusions, reaffirming that most Americans’ policy preferences are well summarized by a single ideological dimension and that most such individuals are ideologically moderate."

For example:\n\nKnutsen et al. (2024) critique Little and Meng’s reliance on objective measures, highlighting issues in conceptualization, indicator selection, and aggregation that may overlook nuanced democratic erosion.\nGorokhovskaia (2024) emphasizes the importance of disaggregating data, noting that while electoral indicators may remain stable, other areas like media freedom show signs of backsliding.\nMiller (2024) contends that objective indicators fail to detect democratic erosion within established democracies, missing subtle but significant declines.\n\nIn a reply, Little and Meng (2024b) acknowledge the critiques and emphasize the need for improved measurement tools to better understand democratic backsliding."

(2024).2 What parts of their arguments do you find most compelling?\nWhat is the value of description in your research area? Take one or two papers that you admire—the kinds of papers that you’d like to write—and ask yourself “what would this project have looked like if the authors had instead focused on carefully describing their critical concepts (rather than looking for their effects and/or causes)?”\n\nData Sets (Optional; due by Sep. 10) Identify publicly available data sets relevant to your general area of interest. For each data set, briefly describe the variables, cases, and time periods included. Flag any variables that seem especially important. Realize there is lots of data available—search deep and wide! And talk to other students and faculty.\nConcepts (Optional; due by Sep. 17) Explore and explain the major theoretical or empirical concepts scholars focus on in your area.\nNarrowing Your Topics (Optional; due by Sep. 24) Narrow your focus by choosing a few concepts you find interesting. Identify FSU faculty working in these areas. Sketch 3–5 potential research questions.\n\n2 See also Part II of Gerring’s Social Science Methodology for a supplement to Gerrying (2012)."
